        <h1>The Age Gap in Hollywood</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hollywood has long been criticized for the noticeable age gap between male and female lead actors. While older male actors frequently play romantic leads alongside much younger female counterparts, the industry has slowly begun to make small changes in recent years. This website explores the trend of age disparities in Hollywood films across different decades, focusing on the 20th century, the 2000s, and the 2010s, with a visual representation of how the age gap has evolved over time.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Database and Process Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Database and Process</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Source of the Database</strong></p>
        <p>I worked with a database consisting of 1,046 movies, covering the period from 1935 to 2024. This database contains information about the main actors in the films, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The birthdate of the male lead actor</li>
            <li>The birthdate of the female lead actress</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using this data, I was able to calculate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The average age of male actors</li>
            <li>The average age of female actresses</li>
            <li>The age gap between the male actor and the female actress in each movie</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal of my project was to analyze the evolution of the age gap between male and female actors in Hollywood over time.</p>
        <p>I used a dataset that had already been cleaned (which was verified via the "Breve" site), so I didnâ€™t need to spend time cleaning the data. It was ready to be used for my analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Data Calculations</strong></p>
        <p>From this database, I performed several important calculations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For each year, I calculated the average age of male actors by subtracting the actor's birth year from the release year of the film.</li>
            <li>Similarly, I calculated the average age of female actresses in the same way.</li>
            <li>Then, I calculated the average age gap between male actors and female actresses each year.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3. Purpose of the Analysis</strong></p>
        <p>I wanted to compare how the age gap between male and female actors has evolved over the years. Specifically, I was interested in comparing the 20th and 21st centuries to see if there were any significant changes. I also wanted to explain the cultural and societal transformations that may have influenced these changes in Hollywood.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Tools Used</strong></p>
        <p>Due to some download issues caused by my old computer, I wasn't able to download certain applications. Instead, I used the online tool <strong>JSFiddle</strong>, which allows me to work directly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provided me with an online environment to write and test my code, and I was able to visualize the data directly within the platform.</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>For decades, Hollywood has been known for pairing older male actors with significantly younger female co-stars. This age gap has not only shaped the on-screen dynamics of iconic films but also reflected deeper cultural norms and biases in the film industry.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 1: Age Gap Trends in Hollywood</p>
            <p>In the 20th century, particularly from the 1930s through the 1970s, Hollywood films often adhered to the traditional casting pattern of older male leads paired with significantly younger female counterparts. This pattern was deeply ingrained in the industry's casting practices, where older male stars were often seen as more desirable and authoritative, while actresses were expected to maintain youth and beauty.</p>
            <p>One notable example is the 1963 film <em>Charade</em>, where 59-year-old Cary Grant starred opposite 34-year-old Audrey Hepburn. In this romantic comedy, Grant played the suave and mysterious lead, while Hepburn portrayed a younger woman entangled in a complex plot. Despite the age gap of 25 years, their on-screen chemistry made the film a beloved classic.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Cary Grant was frequently cast in roles opposite younger actresses, and this pairing in <em>Charade</em> exemplifies the standard practice of casting older men with younger women that was common in the 20th century.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">Figure 2: Age Gap Trends in Hollywood (2000s)</p>

            <p>As Hollywood entered the 2000s and 2010s, there was some gradual progress in the representation of age in film. The early 2000s marked the beginning of a shift, albeit a small one, as female actresses in their 30s and 40s began to secure leading roles alongside older male actors. Films like <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> (2006) featured Meryl Streep, 56, as the powerful and influential Miranda Priestly, a role that not only highlighted her experience and skill but also showed that older women could hold significant power in a story without being relegated to supporting roles.</p>

            </a>
           
            <p>Despite this, the age gap between male and female leads continued to persist, especially in films where romance was central to the plot. Movies such as <em>Catch Me If You Can</em> (2002), starring Leonardo DiCaprio (28) and Christopher Walken (59), maintained this trend of men playing older, dominant roles opposite younger women. However, even in non-romantic films, older men were often cast in roles that were seen as more authoritative, while women were often younger, even when the focus wasnâ€™t on romance.</p>

    <section>
        <button class="accordion">Age Gap in the 2010s</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The transformation of age gaps in Hollywood films since the 2010s can be understood as part of a broader cultural shift, heavily influenced by the feminist movement. The feminist push for gender equality, diversity, and inclusivity has challenged long-standing stereotypes and norms in many areas of society, including Hollywood. As womenâ€™s voices have become louder in the fight for equal representation, the entertainment industry has slowly started to reflect these changes, particularly in how it portrays age and gender on-screen.</p>
            <p>However, while these changes were welcomed, they didn't entirely solve the age gap problem, especially in romantic films. The continued casting of older male actors alongside significantly younger actresses can be viewed as a resistance to completely breaking free from patriarchal norms. Feminist critiques of these practices argue that these films still perpetuate the idea that older men are more desirable, while women lose their value as they age.</p>
            <p>That said, the feminist movementâ€™s influence has been growing stronger in recent years. Actresses like Meryl Streep, Helen Mirren, and Judi Dench have become vocal advocates for greater representation of older women in film, both in terms of number and quality of roles.</p>
